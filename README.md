# about-me

My name is Arjun Kheshav Singh and I'm a mechanical engineer with an undergraduate degree from the University of Texas at Dallas, and an minor in philosophy. My technical interests include manufacturing and fabrication, CAD, and design. I'm trying out various ways to document any new or ongoing projects here, and find some niche between a typical coding portfolio or a more traditional art/architecture portfolio. For now, repositories will serve as portfolios for CAD assemblies, designs, and any full projects I would work on. My professional LinkedIn page is https://www.linkedin.com/in/arjun-k-singh/

One of my internships got me into a bit of a pen obsession so I'm currently collecting fountain pens while learning Devanagari calligraphy. I am an avid student of Hindustani and semi-classical folk music, and I have started learning Hindi (closely followed by Bangla and Sanskrit) during my time spent in a monastery studying music in India. 


[//]: # My interests outside of STEM include some of the classical and medieval languages of India, including Sanskrit and medieval Bengali. I am currently self-studying and learning Sanskrit, and Hindi to an extent. I also enjoy learning, playing, and listening to Hindustani classical and devotional music. My scholarly pursuits include the study of some of the Vaiṣṇava Vedānta philosophical schools of thought.
