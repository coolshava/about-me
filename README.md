# hello-world

My name is Arjun Kheshav Singh and I'm in my third year of the mechanical engineering program in the University of Texas at Dallas. My technical interests include manufacturing and fabrication, CAD, and design. I am currently seeking internship positions for Summer 2020, although I am open to opportunities in Fall 2020 or Spring 2021. Various other repositories will serve as portfolios for CAD assemblies, designs, and any full projects I would work on. My professional LinkedIn page is https://www.linkedin.com/in/arjun-k-singh/

My interests outside of STEM include some of the classical and medieval languages of India, including Sanskrit and medieval Bengali. I am currently self-studying and learning Sanskrit, and Hindi to an extent. I also enjoy learning, playing, and listening to Hindustani classical and devotional music. My scholarly pursuits include the study of some of the Vaiṣṇava Vedānta philosophical schools of thought.
